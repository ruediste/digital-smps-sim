# DIY Digital DC Converters

Building DIY digitally controlled DC converters seems to be largely ignored by the community. That's a gap that needs to be filled!

The material available online seems to be largely targeted at university students and might be a bit hard to approach for the average hobbyist. That's where this repository comes in: The goal is to show how to build increasingly complex converters, in a very hands-on way.

By controlling the converter digitally using standard hobbyist microcontroller boards also used in the arduino ecosystem the circuits can be kept simple and the control algorithms can be quite sophisticated.

## State of the Project
I'm just getting started.
