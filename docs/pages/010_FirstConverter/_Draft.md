, measured in henrys. We'll discuss below how to measure it. The inductance determines how fast the current in the inductor will change if you apply a certain voltage. The formula is

$$ V = L \frac{\Delta I}{T} $$

With 

* $$V$$: The voltage applied to the inductor in volts
* $$L$$: The inductance of the inductor in henrys
* $$\Delta I$$: The change in current of over the given time frame in amperes
* $$T$$: The time the voltage is applied to the inductor in seconds

Usually, we don't need the voltage but are interested in the time for a given current change, or the current change over a given time:

$$ T = L \frac{\Delta I}{V}; \Delta I = \frac{VT}{L}  $$
